# Raceway

How fast can you type? Raceway is a typing trainer for GNOME.

This is a WIP. Dark mode doesn't work because I have to do some stuff with the text view logic for the colors to work out, the project file structure is a mess, and there's almost nothing to see in the app yet, but the text view itself is basically finished at this point. Give it a spin if you'd like to.
