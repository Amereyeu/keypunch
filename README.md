# Keypunch

How fast can you type? This is where I'm building Keypunch, a modern typing trainer for GNOME.

It's not quite ready yet, but it's coming along nicely. Give it a spin if you'd like to.

## Where does "Keypunch" come from?

In addition to sounding super cool, it's the name of an [actual keyboard device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keypunch) that was used for creating punched cards!

## What's missing?

A rough checklist with what has to be in place before the app is ready for its initial release:

- [x] Text view displaying the text as you type it, in addition to highlighting mistakes
- [x] Basic session configuration (simple/advanced, duration)
- [x] Results view showing WPM, accuracy and the session configuration used
- [x] Custom text mode
- [ ] Extensible multi-language text generation for sessions
- [x] Restore previous configuration (window size, session settings, etc.) on open
- [ ] Adequate a11y for visually impaired people
- [ ] UI translation support
- [x] Cursor disappearance upon typing
- [x] Appropriate handling of situations where the text view loses keyboard focus
- [ ] Metadata (icon, links, description, etc.)
- [x] A tidier internal file structure! ðŸ™‚

## Post-release roadmap

- [ ] High score tracking
- [ ] Caps Lock indication
- [ ] Logging of typing speed/accuracy over time, and a nice statistics dialog to view / export these statistics
- [ ] Break reminders (displayed after sessions if the app has been continuously in use for a long time, to avoid finger strain)
- [ ] Frustration relief (stop the session and suggest taking a break when people are obviously mashing keys randomly in frustration)
- [ ] Local-first p2p multiplayer mode (?)
- [ ] Practice mode / typing guide (?)

Feel free to check in once in a while and see the progress on this. The app will be available on Flathub when it's ready.
