# Keypunch

[![Please do not theme this app](https://stopthemingmy.app/badge.svg)](https://stopthemingmy.app)

There is no doubt that typing on a keyboard is an essential skill in the
digital age. Typing fast and accurately gives you more opportunities,
more time for what matters to you, and a sense of self-accomplishment.

Keypunch lets you practice typing. Thanks to fast-paced
sessions with instant feedback afterwards and a plethora of available languages,
you might even have a little fun doing so. With determination, proper technique
and some time, you will observe a noticeable increase in both the speed
and accuracy of which your thoughts and ideas are brought to life on the screen.

If you are already a racer at typing, Keypunch still has something for you.
Try practicing with numbers and punctuation, or choose your own text to type
out as fast as you can.

Get ready to accelerate your typing!

## Installation

The app will be released on Flathub when it's ready.

## Name

In addition to sounding neat, "Keypunch" is the name of an 
[actual keyboard device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keypunch) that was used 
for creating punched cards.

## Roadmap

- High score tracking
- Caps Lock indication
- Logging of typing speed/accuracy over time, and a nice statistics dialog 
  to view / export these statistics
- Break reminders (displayed after sessions if the app has been continuously 
  in use for a long time, to avoid finger strain)
- Frustration relief (stop the session and suggest taking a break when people 
  are obviously mashing keys randomly in frustration)
- Practice mode / typing guide (?)
- Local-first p2p multiplayer mode (?)
