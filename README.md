# Keypunch

How fast can you type? This is where I'm building Keypunch a typing trainer for GNOME.

It's not quite ready yet. The project file structure is a mess, and the text to type is always the same, but it's coming along nicely. Give it a spin if you'd like to.

## What's missing?

A rough checklist before the app is ready for its initial release:

- [x] Text view displaying the text as you type it, in addition to highlighting mistakes
- [x] Basic session configuration (simple/advanced, duration)
- [ ] Results view
- [ ] Custom text mode
- [ ] Extensible text generation for sessions, with the ability to support many different languages
- [ ] Adequate a11y for visually impaired people
- [ ] UI translation support
- [ ] Cursor disappearance upon typing
- [ ] Appropriate handling of situations where the text view loses keyboard focus

Feel free to check in once in a while and see the progress ðŸ™‚
